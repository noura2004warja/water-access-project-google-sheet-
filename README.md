# 🌍 Water Access Project  

## 📖 Overview  
Access to **safe and affordable drinking water** is a fundamental human right, yet service levels vary widely across countries and regions. This project explores these inequalities by analyzing data from the **JMP dataset**, which estimates household access to drinking water services from **2000 to 2020**. The goal is to track progress toward **Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6)**—ensuring clean water and sanitation for all.  

## 📊 Dataset Description  
The dataset includes the following key fields:  

- **Country or Area** – The specific country or region for which estimates are provided.  
- **Year** – The year for which the estimates apply.  
- **Population** – The estimated population (in thousands) for that country and year.  
- **% Urban** – The percentage of the population living in urban areas.  
- **Service Levels** – The percentage of the population with access to different levels of drinking water services (national, rural, and urban).  

### 🏆 Service Levels Explained  
The dataset categorizes water access into five service levels using a **"service ladder"** to compare access across different regions:  

1. **Safely Managed** – Water from an improved source that is:  
   - Available on the premises  
   - Available when needed  
   - Free from fecal and chemical contamination  
2. **Basic** – Water from an improved source with a collection time of **≤30 minutes** per round trip (including queue time).  
3. **Limited** – Water from an improved source, but with a collection time **>30 minutes** per round trip.  
4. **Unimproved** – Water from an **unprotected well** or **unprotected spring**.  
5. **Surface Water** – Water directly collected from **rivers, lakes, ponds, canals, or irrigation channels**.  

## 🎯 Analysis Goals  
This project aims to:  
✅ Track and compare **progress toward SDG 6** across countries and regions.  
✅ Identify **inequalities** in access to safe and affordable drinking water.  
✅ Analyze differences in **urban vs. rural service levels**.
